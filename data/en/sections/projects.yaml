- name: "Planning and Control of a Quadcopter"
  image: /images/sections/projects/rrt_drone.png
  summary: "This project implements an enhanced 3D RRT* (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star) algorithm to plan drone trajectories through a sequence of gates while avoiding obstacles. The planner is adapted for realistic racing conditions, supporting both take-off and landing phases and fine-grained path smoothing for controller execution. Key innovations include sampling biases, strict collision checking during rewiring, and customized handling of drone kinematics (speed profiles, banking angles)."
