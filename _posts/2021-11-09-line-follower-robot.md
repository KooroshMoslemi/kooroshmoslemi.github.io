Back in junior high school, My friends and I designed a line follower robot. Its mainboard was based on an [AVR microcontroller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVR_microcontrollers), and it was designed with [Proteus](https://www.labcenter.com/). We used [Bascom](https://avrhelp.mcselec.com/index.html) to program the robot because it was simple and powerful enough to handle our logic.

Here is a video of we built:
