Our task was to create a mid-term exam schedule for the entire MCS department at the &lt;a href="https://aut.ac.ir/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;AmirKabir University of Technology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary challenge was to devise a schedule that accommodated all students, ensuring that no student had more than one exam on any given day and that there were adequate gaps between exams. Given that each student had a unique set of courses, satisfying everyone&amp;rsquo;s schedule was a complex problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
