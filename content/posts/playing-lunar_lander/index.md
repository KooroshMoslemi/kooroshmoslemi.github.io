This project is an enhancement of the final project from the [Reinforcement Learning specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/J3EH9KB4VPM2). It focuses on using the Expected Sarsa algorithm with a neural network as a function approximator to play Lunar Lander.

The model was trained using Keras and TensorFlow.

The complete source code for this project is available in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/KooroshMoslemi/Playing-Lunar-Lander).
