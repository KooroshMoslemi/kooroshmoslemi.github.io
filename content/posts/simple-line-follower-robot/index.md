This project showcases a simple line follower robot that I designed and built with a team of friends during my junior high school years. The robot's core is an [AVR microcontroller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVR_microcontrollers), and its circuit was designed using [Proteus](https://www.labcenter.com/). For programming, we utilized [Bascom](https://avrhelp.mcselec.com/index.html), a straightforward yet capable language that met our project's requirements.

Below is a video demonstration of the robot in action:
