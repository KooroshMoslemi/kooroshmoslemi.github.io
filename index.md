---

I am a student in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science (MCS) at [AUT](https://aut.ac.ir/en). My field of interest is at the intersection of machine learning and control. In particular, I am passionate about developing intelligent agents with complex behavioral skills through learning and interaction.

I also enjoy spending time in nature, riding a bicycle, playing chess and bug hunting!
